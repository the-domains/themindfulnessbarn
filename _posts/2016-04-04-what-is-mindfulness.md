# What is mindfulness

The most widely accepted definition of mindfulness is the awareness that arises from "paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non judgmentally". This explanation by Jon Kabat-Zinn revolves around three axioms: Intention (on purpose), Attention (paying attention) and Attitude (non judgmentally).
